<h3><b>Something just like this !!</b></h3>
<i>
I've been reading books of old<br>
The legends and the myths<br>
Achilles and his gold<br>
Hercules and his gifts<br>
Spiderman's control<br>
And Batman with his fists<br>
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list<br>
<br><br>
But she said, where'd you wanna go?<br>
How much you wanna risk?<br>
I'm not looking for somebody<br>
With some superhuman gifts<br>
Some superhero<br>
Some fairytale bliss<br>
Just something I can turn to<br>
Somebody I can kiss<br>
<br><br>
I want something just like this<br>
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo<br>
Doo-doo-doo<br>
Oh, I want something just like this<br>
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo<br>
Doo-doo-doo<br>
Oh, I want something just like this<br>
I want something just like this<br>
<br><br>
I've been reading books of old<br>
The legends and the myths<br>
The testaments they told<br>
The moon and its eclipse<br>
And Superman unrolls<br>
A suit before he lifts<br>
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits<br>
<br><br>
She said, where'd you wanna go?<br>
How much you wanna risk?<br>
I'm not looking for somebody<br>
With some superhuman gifts<br>
Some superhero<br>
Some fairytale bliss<br>
Just something I can turn to<br>
Somebody I can miss<br>
<br><br>
I want something just like this<br>
I want something just like this<br>
<br><br>
Oh, I want something just like this<br>
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo<br>
Doo-doo-doo, <br>
Oh, I want something just like this<br>
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo<br>
Doo-doo-doo, <br>

Where'd you wanna go?<br>
How much you wanna risk?<br>
I'm not looking for somebody<br>
With some superhuman gifts<br>
Some superhero<br>
Some fairytale bliss<br>
Just something I can turn to<br>
Somebody I can kiss<br>
I want something just like this<br>
<br><br><br>
Oh, I want something just like this<br>
Oh, I want something just like this<br>
Oh, I want something just like this<br>
<br><br>
<p>Or you can go home.... :D <a href="/">home</a>.</p>
