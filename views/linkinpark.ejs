<h2> Rest In Peace - Chester Bennington - You will be missed. </h2><br/>
<h3> In the end </h3>
<i> It starts with one thing<br/>
I don't know why<br/>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br/>
Keep that in mind<br/>
I designed this rhyme<br/>
To explain in due time<br/>
All I know<br/>
Time is a valuable thing<br/>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br/>
Watch it count down to the end of the day<br/>
The clock ticks life away<br/>
<br/><br/>
It's so unreal<br/>
Didn't look out below<br/>
Watch the time go right out the window<br/>
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know<br/>
Wasted it all just to watch you go<br/>
I kept everything inside<br/>
What it meant to me<br/>
Will eventually be a memory of a time when<br/>
<br/><br/>
I tried so hard<br/>
And got so far<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
I had to fall<br/>
To lose it all<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
<br/><br/>
One thing, I don't know why<br/>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br/>
Keep that in mind<br/>
I designed this rhyme<br/>
To remind myself of a time when<br/>
I tried so hard<br/>
In spite of the way you were mocking me<br/>
Acting like I was part of your property<br/>
Remembering all the times you fought with me<br/>
I'm surprised it got so<br/>
Things aren't the way they were before<br/>
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore<br/>
Not that you knew me back then<br/>
But it all comes back to me in the end<br/>
You kept everything inside<br/>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br/>
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when<br/>
<br/><br/>
I tried so hard<br/>
And got so far<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
I had to fall<br/>
To lose it all<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
<br/><br/>
I've put my trust in you<br/>
Pushed as far as I can go<br/>
For all this<br/>
There's only one thing you should know<br/>
I've put my trust in you<br/>
Pushed as far as I can go<br/>
For all this<br/>
There's only one thing you should know<br/>
<br/><br/>
I tried so hard<br/>
And got so far<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
I had to fall<br/>
To lose it all<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
